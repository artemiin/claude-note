## enqueue

Queue a session event. This is called automatically by Claude Code hooks.

```bash
claude-note enqueue [event_type] [session_id]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `event_type` | Type of event: `tool_use`, `prompt`, `stop`, `test` | Auto-detected from stdin |
| `session_id` | Session identifier | From `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var |

### How hooks use it

Claude Code passes session data via stdin (JSON) and environment variables:

```bash
# Environment variables set by Claude Code
CLAUDE_SESSION_ID=abc-123-def
CLAUDE_WORKING_DIR=/Users/you/project

# Hook invocation (data comes via stdin)
echo '{"type":"tool_use","tool":"Read",...}' | claude-note enqueue
```

### Manual testing

```bash
# Test that enqueue works
CLAUDE_SESSION_ID=test-123 claude-note enqueue test

# Check it was queued
claude-note status
```

---

## drain

Process all pending sessions immediately, without waiting for the worker's normal schedule.

```bash
claude-note drain [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run`, `-n` | Show what would be processed without doing it |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Show detailed processing output |

### When to use

- After installation, to process any backlogged sessions
- When you want immediate synthesis instead of waiting
- After fixing configuration issues

### Example

```bash
# See what's pending
claude-note drain --dry-run

# Process everything now
claude-note drain --verbose
```

---

## worker

Run the background worker process. This is called by launchd/systemd, not manually.

```bash
claude-note worker
```

### What it does

1. Monitors the queue directory for new events
2. Tracks session state (start/activity/stop)
3. Triggers synthesis when sessions end
4. Writes results to vault

### Running manually (for debugging)

```bash
# Stop the service first
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-note.worker.plist  # macOS
# or
systemctl --user stop claude-note  # Linux

# Run in foreground
claude-note worker

# Restart service when done
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-note.worker.plist  # macOS
# or
systemctl --user start claude-note  # Linux
```

---

## clean

Clean up stale state files and fix common issues.

```bash
claude-note clean [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run`, `-n` | Show what would be cleaned without doing it |
| `--force`, `-f` | Clean without confirmation prompts |

### What it cleans

| Item | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| Stale locks | Lock files older than 1 hour |
| Orphaned state | Session state with no recent activity |
| Duplicate sessions | Multiple state files for same session ID |
| Empty queue files | Queue files with no valid events |

### Example

```bash
# See what would be cleaned
claude-note clean --dry-run

# Clean everything
claude-note clean --force
```

---

## index

Rebuild the vault index used for synthesis context.

```bash
claude-note index [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--full` | Full reindex (slower, more thorough) |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Show indexing progress |

### What it indexes

- Note titles and aliases
- Tags and frontmatter
- First paragraph/summary of each note
- Wiki-link connections

### When to use

- After major vault reorganization
- If synthesis isn't finding relevant notes
- After importing many new notes

### Example

```bash
# Quick incremental index
claude-note index

# Full reindex
claude-note index --full --verbose
```

---

## resynth

Re-run synthesis for a specific session.

```bash
claude-note resynth <session_id> [options]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `session_id` | The session ID to re-synthesize (from status or logs) |

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run`, `-n` | Show synthesis output without writing to vault |
| `--model`, `-m` | Override the Claude model |
| `--mode` | Override synthesis mode (log/inbox/route) |

### When to use

- Synthesis failed due to temporary error
- You want to try different synthesis settings
- Testing changes to synthesis prompts

### Example

```bash
# Re-synthesize with defaults
claude-note resynth abc-123-def

# Test with different model
claude-note resynth abc-123-def --model claude-opus-4-20250514 --dry-run
```

## ingest

Ingest external documents (papers, docs) as structured literature notes.

```bash
claude-note ingest <file> [options]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `file` | Document to ingest (.pdf, .docx, .md, .txt) |

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--title`, `-t` | Override the note title (default: filename) |
| `--model`, `-m` | Override Claude model for extraction |
| `--dry-run`, `-n` | Extract knowledge but don't create notes |
| `--internal`, `-i` | Create `int-*` notes in `internal/` instead of `lit-*` |

### What it does

1. **Extracts text** from the document
2. **Analyzes content** using Claude to identify key concepts
3. **Checks for duplicates** using semantic search (if qmd enabled)
4. **Creates/updates notes**:
   - Main literature note (`lit-{title}.md`)
   - Links to existing topic notes
   - Optionally creates new topic notes for novel concepts

### Output structure

```
vault/
├── literature/
│   └── lit-some-paper.md      # Main literature note
├── topic-from-paper.md         # New topic note (if created)
└── existing-topic.md           # Updated with link to paper
```

### Examples

```bash
# Ingest a research paper
claude-note ingest ~/Downloads/attention-is-all-you-need.pdf

# Ingest with custom title
claude-note ingest report.docx --title "Q4 Architecture Review"

# Preview without writing
claude-note ingest paper.pdf --dry-run

# Ingest internal doc
claude-note ingest team-process.md --internal
```
